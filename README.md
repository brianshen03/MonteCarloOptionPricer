# High Performance Computing: European Option Pricer

This project implements a high-performance Monte Carlo simulation to price European call options using real-time market data. It supports both CPU-parallelized (OpenMP) and GPU-accelerated (CUDA) implementations.

## üìà Overview

The program calculates the fair price of a European call option based on:

- `S`: Stock price (live from Tradier API)
- `X`: Strike price (live from Tradier API)
- `T`: Time to expiration (in years)
- `œÉ` (sigma): Volatility (live from Tradier API)
- `r`: Risk-free interest rate (live from FRED 3-month Treasury Bill rate)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Since `r` is based on the 3-month T-bill rate, this pricing model is most accurate when the option's time to maturity `T` is under 3 months. For longer expirations (e.g. 6 months or 1 year), `r` should ideally be adjusted accordingly.

## üß™ Usage

./pricer TICKER THREADS NUM_SIMULATIONS


- `TICKER`: Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL)
- `THREADS`: Number of CPU threads to parallelize simulations (only applies to the OpenMP version)
- `NUM_SIMULATIONS`: Number of Monte Carlo paths to generate

üí° Currently, the simulations are parallelized per option, not per stock. So the performance benefits scale better with fewer options and more simulations.  
Example:  
- ‚úÖ 20 options √ó 10M simulations ‚Üí Good parallelism  
- ‚ùå 5000 options √ó 100 simulations ‚Üí Poor GPU/CPU utilization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

There are two branches:

- `main` ‚Äî CPU version using OpenMP  
- `cuda_port` ‚Äî GPU version using CUDA  

Each branch contains the same interface and functionality, but leverages different hardware acceleration models for comparison and performance benchmarking.

## üöÄ Future Plans

- Expand GPU acceleration (CUDA) to support pricing thousands of options efficiently
- Implement American option pricing using Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)
- Integrate variance reduction techniques (e.g., antithetic variates, control variates)
- Add visualization and performance benchmarks comparing OpenMP and CUDA performance
